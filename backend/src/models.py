### Flow of the models ###
# 1. User sends a message â†’ ChatRequest is created
# 2. Backend processes it using ChatService which maintains Conversation objects
# 3. Each message is stored as a Message object in the conversation
# 4. Response is sent back as a ChatResponse
# 5. Frontend displays the messages using the Message interface
